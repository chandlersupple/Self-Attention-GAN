An implementation of the self-attention GAN (SAGAN) as described in "Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks," by Zhang et al.

The following SAGAN trains on images from the Cifar10 dataset. Benchmark images will be added to the 'images' list during the training process. To view an image, use 'image.array_to_img(image_array)'.
